## Breast Cancer Classification Model

This project is an attempt to analyse cancer data, train a model and classify into malignant or bening cancer cells. 
The data set is a Toy Dataset from the scikit-learn library. Source: [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#toy-datasets)

A detailed description of the model can be found on my [Hashnode](https://jainayushee.hashnode.dev/breast-cancer-classification-using-logistic-regression).
